# Classification-SVM

Project Description:

Your task is to build a classification model that predicts the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. To accomplish this, you'll utilize the popular Iris dataset, which contains measurements for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

How to use the iris dataset in your Python code:
from sklearn import datasets

iris = datasets.load_iris()
